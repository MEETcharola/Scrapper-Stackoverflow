That variable doesn't have to exist. For example, to set the variable  self.edition  to  1  you can do  setattr(self, \"edition\", 1) . \n Therefore, you can pass in the string name of the variable to your  whichButton  function, and use  setattr  to set a variable with that name. \n It would look something like this: \n def whichButton(self, _var, _pressedButton):\n    setattr(self, _var, _pressedButton)\n...\nself.checkScooter = Button(..., command=lambda: self.whichButton(\"edition\", 1))\n...\nself.checkAbonnement = Button(..., command=lambda: self.whichButton(\"abonnement\", 3))\n \n In the above code, clicking either button will either set  self.edition  or  self.abonnement . \n \n There is almost certainly a better solution to your problem, but your question doesn't provide any details about what problem you're really trying to solve. A simple mprovement over this would be to use a dictionary to hold your \"new\" variables rather than creating literally new variables. \n You can do that by defining a dictionary in your  __init__  and then setting it in your  whichButton  function. \n It would look something like this: \n class Something:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._vars = {}\n    def whichButton(self, name, new_value):\n        self._vars[name] = new_value\n \n This has the advantage that all of these special variables exist in a single data structure, separate from the object.

Where if statements must be provided a truthy or falsey value, match-case statements can match against the shape/structure of an object in a concise way. Consider the following example from the PEP: \n def make_point_3d(pt):\n    match pt:\n        case (x, y):\n            return Point3d(x, y, 0)\n        case (x, y, z):\n            return Point3d(x, y, z)\n        case Point2d(x, y):\n            return Point3d(x, y, 0)\n        case Point3d(_, _, _):\n            return pt\n        case _:\n            raise TypeError(\"not a point we support\")\n \n It not only checks the structure of  pt , but also unpacks the values from it and assigns them to  x / y / z  as appropriate. \n    ", "date_posted": "2021-06-13 19:59:34Z", "upvote": "0", "accepted": "NO", "user": {"stack_user_id": "5946921", "name": "Will Da Silva", "reputation_score": "1,642", "gold_badges": "1", "silver_badges": "14", "bronze_badges": "29"}, "answer_comments": []}, {"stack_answer_id": "67962026", "answer_content": "\r\n Performance Considerations\nIdeally, a match statement should have good runtime performance compared to an equivalent chain of if-statements. Although the history of programming languages is rife with examples of new features which increased engineer productivity at the expense of additional CPU cycles, it would be unfortunate if the benefits of match were counter-balanced by a significant overall decrease in runtime performance. \n Although this PEP does not specify any particular implementation strategy, a few words about the prototype implementation and how it attempts to maximize performance are in order. \n Basically, the prototype implementation transforms all of the match statement syntax into equivalent if/else blocks - or more accurately, into Python byte codes that have the same effect. In other words, all of the logic for testing instance types, sequence lengths, mapping keys and so on are inlined in place of the match. \n This is not the only possible strategy, nor is it necessarily the best. For example, the instance checks could be memoized, especially if there are multiple instances of the same class type but with different arguments in a single match statement. It is also theoretically possible for a future implementation to process case clauses or sub-patterns in parallel using a decision tree rather than testing them one by one. \n https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0622/#performance-considerations \n    ", "date_posted": "2021-06-13 19:37:37Z", "upvote": "-1", "accepted": "NO", "user": {"stack_user_id": "13801652", "name": "Heydok", "reputation_score": "1", "gold_badges": 0, "silver_badges": "1", "bronze_badges": 0}, "answer_comments": []}], "question_comments": [{"stack_question_id": "67961895", "stack_question_comment_id": "120122930", "comment_content": "In short, ", "username": "chepner"}]},

The rest of the code sets up the simulation's starting state.  This env.run() is not the run() defined in the Student class \n #Line 1 is more interesting.  There are a couple of patterns for doing simulations.  one pattern uses classes and when a class object is instantiated/created it also starts its simulation process, so you would not need to call the student.run() yourself.  The  __init__()  gets called when you create a class object.  However if you use this pattern then the loop before #line 2 should be changed from \n student = Student(env, reg)\nfor i in range(9):\n    env.process(student.run())\n \n to \n students = [Student(env,reg) for _ in range(10)]\n \n This will create 10 students, each waiting to register.  The advantage of creating 10 students is each one can have individual states, like a unique id number, and collect stats about themselves.  This is very useful in more complex simulations \n This is how this code should have been written. \n The other pattern is where you do call Student.run() yourself.  To do that here you would comment out #line 1 and change the loop counter in the loop above #line 2 from 9 to 10.  The disadvantage here is all your students are using the same class variables.  A more common way of using this pattern is to not use a class, just a def function and call this function 10 times, passing the env, and reg directly to the function \n As written, what this code is really doing is creating one student and that one student is registering 10 times, once when it is created, and then 9 more times in the loop.  While this may demonstrate how a resource is used, I agree this code can be a bit confusing. \n    ", "date_posted": "2021-06-14 02:23:06Z", "upvote": "0", "accepted": "NO", "user": {"stack_user_id": "15294334", "name": "Michael", "reputation_score": "314", "gold_badges": 0, "silver_badges": "1", "bronze_badges": "5"}, "answer_comments": []}], "question_comments": []},
